1. Main Analysis
The primary empirical analysis is implemented in the file Main_FCRGT_Code.m, which reproduces the results presented in Section 5 (Figures 1–4) of the paper.

2. Data Files
TPDN_g.mat: Contains the density-valued functional time series of land temperature anomalies from January 1951 to December 2019.
GRP_den2_full.mat: Contains the density-valued functional time series of temperature-related GRP growth rates over the period 1951–2019.

3. Variance Ratio (VR) Test (Table 1)
To replicate the VR test reported in Table 1, use the R script FCRGT_Nonstat_Test.r together with the Excel data file Data_FCRGT.xlsx.

4. Code for simulation stidy
To replicate the simulation results in the Supplementary Material, use FRNE_HS_upload.r (for estimator accuracy) and FRNE_CI_upload.r (for coverage probability).
